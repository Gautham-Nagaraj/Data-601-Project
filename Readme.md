#  Data 601 Project breast cancer statistics in females

## Introduction and Datasets:
  We will be using 2 datasets in this project: 
  1) SEER dataset [IEEE dataport](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/seer-breast-cancer-data)
  2) Survivability estimate for cancer [statCan](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/search/results/site-search?q=13100158&fq=stclac:2&wb-srch-sub=search)

  The key guiding questions that will help preprocess and shape this dataset are:
    1)What is the survivability rate for different demographics(race), in the SEER datasets
    2)What is the survivability rate of breast cancer in Canada vs USA
